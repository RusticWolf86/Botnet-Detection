#Botnet Detection in Network Traffic Data
##Introduction
This project focuses on detecting botnets in network traffic data using supervised machine learning algorithms. Botnets, networks of compromised computers, pose a significant threat to cybersecurity. They are used for malicious activities such as spamming and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The challenge lies in identifying the command and control infrastructure of these botnets. Our solution aims to address this challenge using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Methodology
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of network traffic data, represented in CSV format. The data is divided into training and testing sets.

Data Preprocessing
We perform several preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, data imputation, and encoding techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Feature Selection
Feature selection is a crucial part of our methodology. We employ techniques like Correlation Matrix and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most significant features for our model.

Algorithms and Experimental Results
Handling Data Imbalance
To address data imbalance, we use techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Random Undersampling.

Ensemble Technique
An ensemble of Random Forest models, combined using majority voting, is used to improve prediction robustness.

Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using tools like Confusion Matrix and Performance Reports.

Results
We discuss the performance of various classifiers, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and assess the overall effectiveness of our approach.
